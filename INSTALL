Currently this is random set of notes explaining steps to build this
system...

{p1,s2,s3} are the names of the DNS servers. {c0} is the conductor.  The
user under which the control occurs on {p1,s2,s3} is 'ops', except for
any setup which is performed as root.  The user 'ops' also must belong
to group 'wheel' (or equivalent).

NAMED_HOME is the location of the named root directory.  In this example
{p1,s2,s3} are FreeBSD 9.1 machines with:

    NAMED_HOME=/etc/named

Generate an rndc key:

{p1,s2,s3}# RNDCK=${NAMED_HOME}/rndc.key
{p1,s2,s3}# [ -f ${RNDCK} ] || rndc-confgen -a -c ${RNDCK}
{p1,s2,s3}# chgrp wheel ${RNDCK}
{p1,s2,s3}# chmod 640 ${RNDCK}
